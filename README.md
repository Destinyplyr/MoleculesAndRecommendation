# MoleculesAndRecommendation

This project was made for the University class "Software Development for Algorithmic Problems".
The task was to apply Recommendation algorithms and Clustering algorithms to a molecule 
configuration set with different distance metrics and compare the final results. 

# What I Learned

* Optimizing Clustering algorithms
* Recommendation techniques
* Unit Testing
